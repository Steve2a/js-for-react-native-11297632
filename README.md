# Array Manipulation Tasks

## Student ID: 11297632

### Task 1: processArray Function
The `processArray` function takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared, and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: formatArrayStrings Function
The `formatArrayStrings` function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by the `processArray` function. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number:

* Capitalize the entire string if the number is even.
* Convert the string to lowercase if the number is odd.
  
### Task 3: createUserProfiles Function
The `createUserProfiles` function takes an array of names and an array of modified names (from Task 2) as arguments. It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
